Welcome to my 42 School Projects repository! 🎓

This repository contains all the projects I am working on during my journey at 42 School. Here, you will find my solutions to the various challenges and exercises presented throughout the program. It will be updated as I progress through the projects.

42 School is a peer-to-peer, project-based learning program that promotes autonomy, problem-solving skills, and student collaboration. There are no formal teachers; students learn through projects, code reviews, and peer evaluations.
